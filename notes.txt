 http://localhost:8888

Host numbers to avoid
0 - used to identify the network itself
255 - usually used for the broadcast address
1 - used as a gateway or a router

IP Addresses to avoid as reused for internal networks
10.0.0.0/8
172.16.0.0/12
192.168.0.0/16

You should avoid using the IP multicast ranges from 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255 as these addresses may be interpreted specially.

Other special IP Addresses
127.0.0.1  - is the localhost address
0.0.0.0 - means that all network interfaces should be used

useful commands I found:
 netstat -aon | findstr :2200 - to see PID is using port 2200  
 tasklist /FI "PID eq <PID>" - names the program using that PID (change <PID> with relevant PID)

 VBoxManage controlvm "COSC349-Assignment1_dbserver_1756770120690_13684" poweroff - for when I didn't shut down my dbserver properly

 netstat -aon | findstr :8080 - windows equivalent of lsof -pni
 taskkill /PID 2660 /F - kills pid using process
